# Pinterest Contest

Built for my company [t+j designs](http://www.tandjdesigns.com) to manage a Pinterest contest we're running.

I hope to develop this into a reusable app that my sisters can use to setup and manage contests they want to run.

To do:

 - Add admin to view entries
 - Add random winner selector

Future nice to haves: 
 - Export winners to csv
 - CRUD new images to pin
 - Easy way to edit copy
